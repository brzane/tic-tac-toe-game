# Tic Tac Toe game with AI Algorithms
## Overview:
This Project is built with passion to learn how computers can play against us in simple famous game tic tac toe which uses Two player game concept 
you can check my other project which uses the same ideas but with different game to understand the algorithms more: https://github.com/brzane/blob-war-game 
## What this Project contains:
 1- CLI representation of the gamePlay.<br>
 2- You can choose between two AI Algorithms so the computer can apply in the game.<br>
### MinMax Algorithm:
Is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case  (maximum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"â€”to maximize the minimum gain. Originally formulated for n-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision-making in the presence of uncertainty.
### AlphaBeta Algorithm:
Is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games (Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Connect 4, etc.). It stops evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move to be worse than a previously examined move. Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision
## How to use this project:
This project was implemented with C++ programming language and CodeBlocks IDE so you can clone this repo and use it with any IDE that supports C++
